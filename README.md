## Example usage

Grab a Phabricator token at `https://<yourserver.com>/settings/panel/apitokens/`

Configure in Linux:

     export PHAB_TOKEN=cli-ABC123
    --OR--
     echo "PHAB_TOKEN: cli-ABC123" > ~/.config/phabfive.yaml

Configure in Windows:

    Phabfive looks for configuration in the following sequence in Windows environment

    %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\phabfive\phabfive.yaml
    %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\phabfive\phabfive.d\*.yaml
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\phabfive\phabfive.yaml
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\phabfive\phabfive.d\*.yaml

    Make sure there is a minimum phabfive.yaml store in one of the location
    e.g. `echo "PHAB_TOKEN: cli-ABC123" > %LOCALAPPDATA%\phabfive\phabfive.yaml`

    Additionally, due to connection to Phabricator server on HTTPS requires certificate verification, it is also recommended to install [pip_system_certs](https://pypi.org/project/pip-system-certs/) to ensure system store are linked to python.

    pip install pip_system_certs

Usage:

    phabfive passphrase K123
    phabfive --log-level=DEBUG user whoami


## Run local development phabricator instance

This is not necessary if you have existing Phabricator instance setup to test against

First add the following `127.0.0.1       phabricator.domain.tld` to your `/etc/hosts` file

Next start the mysql instance separate from the phabricator instance with

    docker compose -f docker-compose-phabricator.yml up mysql

Then after the database is up and running yo ucan start the webserver with

    docker compose -f docker-compose-phabricator.yml up phabricator

This startup will take some time to setup the demo instance. Once completed you can access your instance in your browser at `http://phabricator.domain.tld/`.

On first use you need to setup your admin account. Most development for phabfive requires an API token, create one here `http://phabricator.domain.tld/settings/user/<username>/page/apitokens/`

Note there is no persistance disks so if the container is shutdown any data will be lost and you have to restart


## Building a release

For version schema we follow basic SemVer versioning schema system with the extensions that is defined by python in this PEP440 https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/ It allows for some post and dev releases if we need to, but in general we should only publish stable regular semver releases.

Instructions how to build a release and upload it to PyPi can be found here in the official build tools documentation site https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/

In order to be allowed to upload a new release for phabfive, you need to be a Owner or maintainer for this project inside PyPi. Currently only Johan and Henrik is owners. Ask them for assistance if you need upload permissions for a new release.
