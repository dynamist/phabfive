description: |
  This template finds tasks that are technically resolved but still sitting
  in active columns on workboards. These tasks should typically be moved to
  a "Done" or similar completion column to keep boards clean.

  Example usage:
    phabfive maniphest search --with templates/task-search/tasks-resolved-but-not-in-done.yaml

  You can override any parameter from the command line:
    phabfive maniphest search --with templates/task-search/tasks-resolved-but-not-in-done.yaml --tag "other-project"
