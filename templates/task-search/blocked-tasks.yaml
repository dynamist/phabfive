  This template finds tasks that are currently blocked or have spent time
  in blocking states. This can help identify workflow bottlenecks and
  understand where work gets stuck.

  The search looks for tasks currently in "Blocked" columns or that have
  previously been in "Waiting" or "Blocked" states.

  Example usage:
    phabfive maniphest search --with templates/task-search/blocked-tasks.yaml

  Combine with specific projects:
    phabfive maniphest search --with templates/task-search/blocked-tasks.yaml --tag "my-project"
