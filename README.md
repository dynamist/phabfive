echo "PHAB_TOKEN: cli-ABC123" > ~/.config/phabfive.yaml

```

## Run local development phabricator instance

First add the following to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```text
127.0.0.1       phabricator.domain.tld
```

Next start the mysql instance separate (in the first terminal) from the phabricator instance with

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-phabricator.yml up mysql
```

Then after the database is up and running you can start the webserver with (in a second terminal)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-phabricator.yml up phabricator
```

This startup will take some time to setup the demo instance. Once completed you can access your instance in your browser at `http://phabricator.domain.tld/`. On first use you need to setup your admin account. Most development for phabfive requires an API token, create one here `http://phabricator.domain.tld/settings/user/<username>/page/apitokens/`.

Note there is no persistence disks so if the container is shutdown any data will be lost and you have to restart.

## Building a release

For version schema we follow basic [SemVer](https://semver.org/) versioning schema system with the extensions that is defined by python in this [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). It allows for some post and dev releases if we need to, but in general we should only publish stable regular semver releases.

Instructions how to build a release and upload it to PyPi can be found in the official [packaging documentation at Python.org](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

In order to be allowed to upload a new release for phabfive, you need to be a *owner* or *maintainer* for this project inside PyPi. Currently only Johan and Henrik are owners. Ask them for assistance if you need permissions to upload a new release.
